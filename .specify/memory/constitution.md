# opencode Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Library-First
Every feature starts as a standalone library; Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only libraries

### II. CLI Interface
Every library exposes functionality via CLI; Text in/out protocol: stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr; Support JSON + human-readable formats

### III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced

### IV. Integration Testing
Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas

### V. Observability, VI. Versioning & Breaking Changes, VII. Simplicity
Text I/O ensures debuggability; Structured logging required; Or: MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format; Or: Start simple, YAGNI principles

## Additional Constraints

Technology stack requirements, compliance standards, deployment policies, etc.

## Development Workflow

Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc.

## Governance
Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan
